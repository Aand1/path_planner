### Hybrid A* Path Planner for the KTH Research Concept Vehicle

The code in this repository is the result of my master's thesis which I am currently writing at the Integrated Research Lab (ITRL) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.


The goal of the thesis and hence this code is to create a real-time path planning algorithm for the nonholonomic Research Concept Vehicle (RCV). The algorithm uses a binary obstacle map as an input, generated using LIDAR mounted on top of the vehicle. The algorithm is being developed using C++ due to real-time requirements in combination with ROS to ensure modularity and portability as well as using RViz as a visualization/simulation environment.

##### Key Characteristics
* Sampling in continuous space with 72 different headings per cell (5Â° discretization)
* Constrained Heuristic - _nonholonomic without obstacles_
* Unconstrained Heuristic - _holonomic with obstacles_
* Dubin's Shot
* C++ real-time implementation (~10 Hz)

Large parts of the implementation are closely related to the hybrid A* algorithm developed by Dmitri Dolgov and Sebastian Thrun (_Path Planning for Autonomous Vehicles in Unknown Semi-structured Environments_ DOI: 10.1177/0278364909359210)
